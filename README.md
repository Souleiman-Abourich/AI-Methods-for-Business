# Hello all, we embark on a journey ðŸš€

Welcome to the repository for our **Final Assignment: AI Methods for Business 24/25**! This project showcases our exploration into applying machine learning to answer a real-world business question using the **Metacritic dataset**.

## Project Overview  
### Objective  
We aim to:
- Formulate a relevant business question and related research sub-questions.
- Leverage advanced machine learning models to answer these questions.
- Deliver actionable insights through data analysis and model interpretation.

### Key Components
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning**  
   - Understand the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
   - Address data quality issues such as missing values and outliers.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extract meaningful features through scaling, encoding, transformation, and embeddings using Huggingface models.

3. **Model Implementation**  
   - Fit and tune machine learning models, including Random Forests and Neural Networks.
   - Compare their performance and select the best model.

4. **Explainability & Interpretability**  
   - Use SHAP and counterfactual analysis to interpret predictions.  

5. **Bonus Challenges**  
   - Explore topic modeling with transformer-based clustering.
   - Perform cluster analysis to identify meaningful data groupings.

## Deliverables
1. **Python Code**  
   - Jupyter notebooks covering data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and explainability.

2. **Presentation Video**  
   - A concise 10-minute overview of the methodology, results, and team contributions.

3. **Presentation Slides**  
   - Supporting materials for the video presentation.
